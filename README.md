just doing some symlink bullshit temporarily until real [dotfiles](obsidian://open?vault=Ext%20Brain&file=dotfiles) solution



precommit can resolve symlinks to real files; fig out same thing but for aliases; also periodically run eclecticlight's alias fixing program

# zsh

- [ ] Look thru `.zshrc copy` and `.zshrcplayground` to see if missing anything from there

- [ ] go thru the files there's a bunch of todos in em and messy stuff
- [ ] fig out how i want to organize "functions" make sure they load async etc

[main obsid note](obsidian://open?vault=Ext%20Brain&file=Shell%20Commands)

[zsh scripting obsid note](obsidian://open?vault=Ext%20Brain&file=zsh%20scripting)

they're both inc, but eventually put a tldr of em in repo

- [ ] set up gh action to test how all the benchmarks change after every commit, make a graph
- [ ] alisma git hook for aliases 



how does current hook work?
