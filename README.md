just doing some symlink bullshit temporarily until real [dotfiles](obsidian://open?vault=Ext%20Brain&file=dotfiles) solution

# zsh

- [ ] Look thru `.zshrc copy` and `.zshrcplayground` to see if missing anything from there

- [ ] fig out how i want to organize "functions" make sure they load async etc

[main obsid note](obsidian://open?vault=Ext%20Brain&file=Shell%20Commands)

[zsh scripting obsid note](obsidian://open?vault=Ext%20Brain&file=zsh%20scripting)
